### What I learned

I had some hard time making the deisgn responsive because I had used only margins and paddings for the positioning but after making some reearch, I was able to use the flexbox to make it work. Again, the mobile version was slightly right aligned and I didn't know what could cause it as I had inspected the margin properties using the chrome develper too. Thankfully, I later figured that deleting the default 8px margin could help and it did solve the problem.
